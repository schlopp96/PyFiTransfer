# PyFiTransfer

> **_Python File Transfer v0.3.0_**

## About

- **_PyFiTransfer_** is a simple program developed as a way to easily transfer files of a given extension-type from one directory to a destination directory.

- Created as a solution for easily moving gaming screenshots to my primary "pictures" folder easily without having to manually _copy-and-paste_ after every time playing a game.

## Usage

1. To use PyFiTransfer, start by running the python script located here:

   - `"../PyFiTransfer/src/main.py"`

2. Enter the file-path to the directory containing the files you wish to transfer.

3. Enter the file-path to the directory acting as the file transfer's destination.

4. Enter the file-type of the files you wish to transfer (not including the "." that proceeds the file type).

   - Example:
     - You would enter (without the quotations) `"exe"` when needing to migrate files with the `".exe"` extension.

5. If everything is correctly validated, a success message is returned to the console, alongside a list of files that were successfully transferred.

   - If an error occurs, the program will display an error message before exiting.

6. Finally, the user is prompted to press the `[ENTER]` key to exit the process.
